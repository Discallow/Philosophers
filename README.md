## Overview
This project simulates the Dining Philosophers Problem, a classic synchronization problem first proposed by Edsger Dijkstra. The problem involves a number of philosophers seated around a table with a fork between each pair. Philosophers alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping. To eat, a philosopher needs two forks (or "chopsticks"), one from the left and one from the right. This project demonstrates how to handle concurrency issues such as deadlocks and race conditions.

## Usage

To compile and run the program:

  ```bash
    make
    ./philosophers <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
Example:
  ```bash
    ./philosophers 5 800 200 200
```
Arguments:

<number_of_philosophers>: Number of philosophers and forks.

<time_to_die>: Time (in ms) that a philosopher can go without eating before dying.

<time_to_eat>: Time (in ms) that a philosopher spends eating.

<time_to_sleep>: Time (in ms) that a philosopher spends sleeping.

[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat] (optional): The number of times each philosopher must eat before the simulation ends. If not provided, the simulation will run indefinitely until a philosopher dies.

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand and implement concurrency using threads.
- Properly manage resources with mutexes to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
- Optionally, manage inter-process communication using semaphores and processes for the bonus.

---

## Mandatory Part

The mandatory part of this project requires implementing the dining philosophers simulation using threads and mutexes.

### Key Requirements:
- Each philosopher must be a separate thread.
- Forks are represented as mutexes to avoid simultaneous access.
- The program should log when each philosopher starts eating, sleeping, or thinking.
- If a philosopher does not start eating within time_to_die milliseconds since their last meal, they are considered dead, and the simulation stops.

### Program Workflow:

- Each philosopher attempts to pick up the two forks adjacent to them.
- After obtaining both forks, the philosopher eats, then releases the forks and goes to sleep.
- After sleeping, the philosopher starts thinking and the cycle continues.
- If a philosopher exceeds time_to_die without eating, the program should print that the philosopher has died and terminate.
Example Output:
    ```bash
    0    ms 1 is thinking
    5    ms 1 is eating
    15   ms 2 is sleeping
    ...
    500  ms 3 has died

## Bonus Part

- The bonus part of the project extends the requirements by using processes and semaphores instead of threads and mutexes.

### Key Requirements:

- Implement each philosopher as a separate process.
- Use semaphores to manage the forks.
- Each philosopher process monitors their own state to check if they exceed the time_to_die.
- The main process should be able to track the philosophers and stop the simulation when a philosopher dies.
- You must handle inter-process communication and termination properly to avoid zombie processes.

### Additional Bonus Features:

- Add a semaphore to control when all philosophers start eating, so they pick up forks at nearly the same time.
- Ensure robust cleanup of all processes and semaphores to prevent resource leakage.
- Ensure all resources (threads, mutexes, processes, semaphores) are properly cleaned up to avoid memory leaks and dangling processes.
- Use resource ordering or a timeout mechanism to avoid deadlocks where philosophers wait indefinitely for forks.

## Conclusion

- The Philosophers project provides valuable insight into solving concurrency problems and managing shared resources. By implementing this classic problem, I gained hands-on experience with threads, mutexes, processes, and semaphores, deepening my understanding of how to prevent issues like deadlocks and race conditions. 
- Successfully managing these resources requires careful synchronization and clear structuring of interdependent processes, skills essential for building robust, concurrent systems.
- Additionally, the optional bonus feature of implementing the simulation using semaphores and processes (instead of just threads and mutexes) allowed me to explore inter-process communication and process management in more depth with semaphores.

Overall, this project is a challenging yet rewarding exercise that combines theoretical concepts with practical coding skills, providing a solid foundation in multithreading and concurrencyâ€”skills that are highly applicable in real-world applications requiring efficient resource management.
